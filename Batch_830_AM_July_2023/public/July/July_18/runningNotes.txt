Diff btwn Display none and visibility hidden

CSS display property:

    disipaly:  none/ inline/block/inline-block/ flex/grid ..

            display: none -> makes any dom element to be not visible on the page, but the element still remains within the DOM structure


            display: inline -> It will force any dom element to get rendered as like an inlie element. 

             display: block -> It will force any dom element to get rendered as like an block  element. 

              display: inline-block -> Makes element to render within the same line as like inline, but still we could control the dimentions of it as like block level elements
