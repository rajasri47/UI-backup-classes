CSS Positions:
    when we want to move any dom element to any required positon with in the page, without changing the dimentions, we use the below 4 css properties 

        top
        right
        bottom
        left 

    The above 4 css props can only be considerd by the DOM elements which are positioned as non static. 

        CSS property position will take below possible values:

            position: static/relative/absolute/fixed/sticky;

        position: static:
            It os not going to consider the above 4 css props, it cannot be moved from the default position

        Position Relative:


        Any dom element which is a static, will fall by default under x,y axis , and the elements under x,y axis cannot be moved to new position 

        Any dom elements with position non static, will automatically move from default xy axis to z axis
