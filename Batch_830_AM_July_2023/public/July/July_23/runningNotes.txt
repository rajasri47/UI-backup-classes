GET, POST, PUT, DElete, Query....

Two types of communications while communicating with server
    method:

    GET - Its is a non secured way of communicating, where data will be sent to the server by url rewriting (query params)

    <form action="http://sample.com/data/userinfo" method = "POST">
        <input type=text name = uname>
        uname, uage, upasswd 
    </form>
        



            action="http://sample.com/data/userinfo"
            action="http://amazon.com/dta/samle"
            action="http://localhost:8081/sdfS"

                    http://sample.com/data/userinfo?uname=test&uage=20&upasswd=hello123#

                    http://abcsample.com/data/api/registration?ufirstname=Hello&lname=test&actPwd=hllo1223&gender=male&ucountry=China&lng_eng=on&lng_tel=on&abouturslf=am+good

        POST - DAta will be sent to the server in a secured way, by appending data to the request header 

        Request header - an object which will be automatically sent to the server by default, which has all the extra information regarding the request been created (time, the ip, locaiton ,,,,type ofdata, )
