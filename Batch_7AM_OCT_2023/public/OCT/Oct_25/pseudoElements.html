            The Prime Minister was given a traditional welcome by organisers on the dais at the venue, as a sea of crowd waited eagerly to watch ‘Lanka Dahan’.
            PM Modi began his speech with chants of “Siyavar Ramchandra Ki Jai’ and wished citizens a very happy Navratri and Vijayadashami.            
            In a veiled attack on INDIA bloc, which has been pushing for caste census across the country, the Prime Minister said ‘Ravan Dahan’ shouldn’t be about only about burning of an effigy but also about forces which try to divide ‘Maa Bharati’ in the name of casteism and regionalism.
