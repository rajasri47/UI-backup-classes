Inline and block level elements

    2 types 

    Block level element
        best example - div tag 

        1. by default every block level element will try to render in the new line, the element which is following the block level element, also comes to new line
        2. By defualt every block level element occupies 100% widht of the container
        3. we can control the dimentions of any block level element by css prop (width, height)


    Inline elements:

        best examle - span
        1. The inline elements never come to new line, they occupy within the same line. 
        2. The width/height of an inline element always depends on the content what it is holding, we cannont control the dimentions of an inline element
